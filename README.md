# Amazon-Clone
🛒 Amazon Homepage Clone

A front-end clone of the Amazon homepage built using HTML and CSS. This project focuses on recreating the layout, structure, and visual styling of a real-world e-commerce platform while improving responsive design and UI development skills.

🚀 Project Overview

The objective of this project was to understand how large-scale e-commerce websites structure their interface and maintain visual consistency across multiple sections. The clone replicates key homepage components including navigation, search functionality layout, promotional banners, product categories, and footer sections.
Special attention was given to spacing, alignment, typography, and layout hierarchy to closely match the look and feel of the original platform.
